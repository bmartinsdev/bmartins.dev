        <p>Hi, my name is Bruno and this is my personal website. Currently working in Portugal as a Software Engineer, I am a full stack developer with a passion for minimal design and efficient code. My daily job consist of developing new features for a multinational application with half a million users.</p>
        <p>Everything you see on this website I'm developing in my spare time, as a way to learn new skills and improve others.</p>
        <p>On the portfolio page you will find everything that I end up building and links to <a href="https://github.com/lughapp" class="hover-underline" target="_blank">Github repos</a>. On the todo page you can see what I am currently working on and you can also follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/LughAppDev" class="hover-underline" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to read about my developing process and my recent work.</p>
